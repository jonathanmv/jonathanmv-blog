We start with an authenticated account. If you'd like to know how to authenticate on Twitter/X using Playwright, read [this post](/blog/tweet-using-playwright).

Much of the code is similar to what we did before. So let's go straight to it

```ts
  await goHome(page);

  // Open a tweet
  const showMore = await page.$("span:has-text('Show more')");
  await showMore.click();
  await page.waitForSelector("span:has-text('Post')");

  // Go to the author's profile
  const tweetUrl = page.url(); // https://x.com/username/status/2342345
  const username = tweetUrl.split("/")[3];
  await page.goto(`https://x.com/${username}`);

  // Open its "following" list
  await page.click("a[href*='/following']");

  // follow the first 3 users
  const followButtons = await page
    .locator("//span[contains(text(), 'Follow')]")
    .all();
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    await followButtons[i].click();
  }
```

The [source code](https://github.com/michalevids/playwright-utils/blob/5a59ffea1d78284556649a19ec0adff2a47c1ffa/scripts/twitter/follow-from-following.ts#L17) is a bit different.
It has intentional wait-times. My intention is to make the behavior less robotic and more human by introducing delays.

I'm still learning Playwright. While doing this, I learned how to get all elements using a [locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators).
Before, I only knew how to click on an element. This time, I didn't want to click on all "Follow" buttons. So, I listed `all` elements and then clicked on some of them.

Getting all elements is considered a [rare case](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators#rare-use-cases) by Playwright, haha.
